We need two repos:    
1. RepoRanger (This repo. It will host all the code related to the Discord bot)  
2. [RepoRanger-Playground (This is for testing, the bot will communicate with this repo.)](https://github.com/kanadn/RepoRanger-Playground)  

Whether to use GitHub Apps or OAuth?  
  I have already created a GitHubApp.

Manifests allow people to create preconfigured GitHub Apps, see [Creating a GitHub App from a manifest.](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/creating-github-apps/creating-a-github-app-from-a-manifest)
